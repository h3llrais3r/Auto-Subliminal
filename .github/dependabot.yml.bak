# Dependabot limitations:
# - No creation of PR for updates that are not allowed (f.e. if higer python version is required, no PR is created for the dependency)
# - No write rights (See heck https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action#commits-made-by-this-action-do-not-trigger-new-workflow-runs to fix it)
# - Not able to run auto commit action because of limitation above (unless we can fix it)
# - This file needs to be committed in master branch before it will start to work

# TODO: Enable me (remove .bak extension from this file) disable renovate (remove renovate.json) when issues above are addressed
